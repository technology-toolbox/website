Apparently you cannot delete a site containing a large amount of content in Microsoft  Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007. Last week I deleted -- or rather, attempted  to delete -- a Document Center site in our Test environment in order to recreate  it (to fix some bugs in our document migration process). Unfortunately, the deleteweb.aspx  page timed out and left the database in an inconsistent state -- attempts to browse  to the site ([http://server/Archive/Library](http://server/Archive/Library))  returned HTTP 400 - Bad Request. The "deleted" site showed up in the list of site  collections in Central Administration (although you could not select it in order  to delete it) but it did not show up in "{{< kbd "stsadm -o enumsites" >}}". Attempts  to recreate the site (upon activation of one of our custom features) also failed  with the following error:

{{< blockquote "font-italic text-danger" >}}

The system cannot find the path specified. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070003)

{{< /blockquote >}}

Something similar happened last month on my initial deployment to TEST (I pressed {{< kbd "CTRL+C" >}} while activating one of the features that creates sites and ended  up corrupting the database). At that time I simply deleted the Web application and  recreated it.

We are planning on rebuilding our Test environment at least once sometime during  the next couple of weeks. However, I did not want to perform a rebuild last week  since it would interrupt the Test team (i.e. the /Archive/Library site is only a  fraction of the feature set we were currently testing and we have several hundred  gigabytes of content in other site collections to support the testing of those features).  I was prepared to delete the entire Web application but only as a last resort.

Since my goal was to get TEST up and running as quickly as possible, I ended  up using SQL Profiler while browsing the Central Administration page that listed  my defunct site. This showed me that the site was still listed in the SiteMap table  of the SharePoint\_Config database. I then ran the following statement to remove  the site:

```
DELETE FROM SiteMap
WHERE Id = 'A4E86B02-49E1-4960-843E-125BB13D6C54'
```

This allowed me to activate the feature again which recreated the /Archive/Library  site. It is important to note that *executing SQL statements directly against
any SharePoint database is completely unsupported* (meaning you shouldn't bother  calling PSS once you have directly made any updates to the database). However, in  our case, this risk was mitigated by the fact that we'll be deleting the databases  during a rebuild soon. Otherwise, I definitely would have opted to open a case with  PSS and let them guide us through the resolution of the issue.

So...lessons learned:

- Do not use the Web application to delete a large site (e.g. a Document Center
  with lots of content) since it could timeout and leave your SharePoint databases
  in an inconsistent state; use "{{< kbd "stsadm.exe -o deletesite" >}}" or "{{< kbd "stsadm.exe -o deleteweb" >}}" instead
- Not all data for a particular Web application is stored in the content database
  (e.g. WSS\_Content); a small amount of data about the site is also stored in
  SharePoint\_Config
- Deleting a site does not perform a distributed transaction across the content
  database and the configuration database (the root of the issue when deleting
  a large site)
