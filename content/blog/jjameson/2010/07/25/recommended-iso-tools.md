I added a new item to my
[Toolbox](/blog/jjameson/2007/03/22/backedup-and-notbackedup) this weekend --
[LC ISO Creator](http://www.lucersoft.com/freeware.php). It's not fancy, or even
supported, but it is free and it appears to do what it is supposed to without
issue, specifically creating an ISO image from an existing CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.
There's no setup program, just a tiny EXE (and ReadMe file) with a "minimalist"
user interface. In other words, it shows a dropdown list to allow you to select
which drive to rip to an ISO file, a **Create ISO** button, and a progress
indicator. Simply insert a CD or DVD that you no longer want to carry around
with you, click the button, specify the location of the ISO file to create, and
a few minutes later you can say goodbye to the physical media (although you
probably should store it somewhere just to be safe).

In these days of terabyte hard drives, DVD-ROMs -- and especially CD-ROMs -- are
starting to seem a little like floppy disks (in terms of "storage density"). Why
tote around disks in your bag when you can store dozens of them (or technically
even a couple hundred) on a small USB drive?

For a few years now, I've also been using
[Virtual CloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html) to mount
ISO images. Years ago when MSDN started switching over to ISO files, I used a
tool provided by Microsoft to avoid having to burn an ISO image to a CD or DVD
in order to install some software. However, that tool stopped working after
switching to Vista and consequently I went looking for another tool. I tried
Daemon Tools for a while, but got fed up with all of the "crap" that got
installed along with it. Virtual CloneDrive is much better, in my opinion.

I hope you find these tools as valuable as I do.
