I've mentioned before that I became somewhat of a
[Web standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards) zealot several years
ago. Consequently, regardless of whether I'm building Web sites using the core
ASP.NET platform or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007, I strive to
ensure that minimal, semantic HTML markup is used to render the site. I then
leverage CSS rules to define the presentational aspects of the content. Note
that this can sometimes seem like an epic battle between the Web developer and
the underlying platform.

Anyone who has worked with SharePoint in sufficient depth knows all too well
that the underlying markup generated by the out-of-the-box features can be very
complex -- and definitely not "semantic." Table-based layouts are used virtually
everywhere in MOSS 2007, and while CSS rules are utilized for much of the
styling, you'll quickly encounter limitations when trying to customize the
look-and-feel of your site.

However, it's important to understand that you _can_ create Web sites using MOSS
2007 that are _mostly_ Web standards compliant -- without abandoning a large
amount of the "out-of-the-box goodness" that you get with MOSS 2007.

For example, I'm not willing to forgo using Web Parts entirely on a MOSS 2007
Web site just for the sake of achieving strict XHTML compliance. Others may
disagree, but in my opinion, this isn't an acceptable tradeoff.

Some specific examples where OOTB Web Parts provide incredible value -- at the
cost of some less-than-ideal markup -- are the search pages for the
[Agilent Technolgies](http://www.chem.agilent.com/en-US/Search/Pages/default.aspx?k=purification)
and
[KPMG](http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/Search/Pages/Results.aspx?k=corporate+governance)
sites (both of which I originally built). Sure, you could choose to create your
own search Web Parts that create the exact look-and-feel originally specified by
your client, but that's not how a good SharePoint developer should approach the
problem. As I've said numerous times before, I often find myself ripping out
large amounts of customization and replacing the functionality with
out-of-the-box features. This isn't always easy, but usually you can convince
your client that changing the user experience a little (e.g. paging through
search results) in order to eliminate large amounts of custom code is inevitably
a very good thing.

If at this point you are thinking something along the lines of "but, Jeremy,
that means all the Web sites built on SharePoint will essentially look the
same," then I encourage you to compare the search result pages on the
[Agilent](http://www.chem.agilent.com/en-US/Search/Pages/default.aspx?k=purification)
and
[KPMG](http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/Search/Pages/Results.aspx?k=corporate+governance)
sites. Yes there are clearly similarities between the two. For example, both
sites provide a faceted search feature to allow users to quickly narrow their
search results based on one or more property filters. However, neither one looks
much like the out-of-the-box Search Center in MOSS 2007 (even though both of
them are based on that site template).

On my most recent project, we are building an Internet-facing customer portal
based on MOSS 2007. One of the first things I did shortly after joining the
project was convert the existing proof-of-concept to use a Web standards design,
stripping out large amounts of markup and simplifying the CSS dramatically.

Rather than defining all of the CSS layout from scratch, I chose to utilize the
[960 Grid System](http://960.gs). For those of you that are still deeply rooted
in using table-based layout, a grid is simply a combination of vertical columns,
horizontal fields, and white space gutters (in other words, just say "no" to
spacer GIFs and an ungodly number of nested tables).

The 960 Grid System provides two variants: 12 columns and 16 columns. However,
we are currently only using the 12 column layout for this site. I should also
note that we are using a fixed-width design (although there are "fluid"
alternatives available based on the 960 Grid System). Bear in mind that things
get considerably more complex when trying to support arbitrary sizing of the
browser window (which is actually something that SharePoint does very well
out-of-the-box with its table-based layout).

To understand how the 960 Grid System is used on our SharePoint site, consider
the following master page:

                    Generally speaking, style attributes should be avoided in
                    HTML. Styling should instead be applied exclusively through
                    CSS.

                    However the SharePoint SiteActionMenu control emits HTML
                    similar to the following:

                        <table height="100%" class="ms-siteaction" ...>
                            ...
                        </table>

                    When CSS is disabled, the height of the SiteActionMenu is
                    ridiculous (which makes it more difficult to troubleshoot
                    other styling issues). Consequently, limit the height of the
                    container <div> to avoid this issue.
                --%>
                <div id="siteactionmenu" style="height: 18px">
                    <PublishingSiteAction:SiteActionMenu runat="server" />
                </div>
                <div class="welcome">

```

This is very similar to the
[minimal master page example on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa660698.aspx)
-- but with some important changes. I'll cover the important similarities as
well as the differences in the remainder of this post.

Ignoring the differences in the page directives (which are irrelevant when
discussing Web standards), the first thing you'll notice is that the master page
specifies a DOCTYPE:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

You should always specify a DOCTYPE in your Web pages in order to avoid the
dreaded [quirks mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode) in Web browsers.
Since, as I noted earlier, the markup emitted by SharePoint isn't always ideal,
avoid the temptation to specify a strict DOCTYPE, such as:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

When I attended some training last summer on SharePoint 2010, I remember hearing
that the new version is supposed to be compliant with XHTML strict. However, I
don't know if that will actually hold true, but regardless, the current version
-- as they say -- "is what it is."

In the MSDN minimal master page sample, the following items immediately follow
the `<html>` element:

```ASP.NET
  <WebPartPages:SPWebPartManager runat="server"/>
  <SharePoint:RobotsMetaTag runat="server"/>
```

Since the `<html>` element should only contain `<head>` and `<body>` elements,
the
[SPWebPartManager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.webpartpages.spwebpartmanager.aspx)
control should be placed within the `<form>` element inside the `<body>`
element, and the
[RobotsMetaTag](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.webcontrols.robotsmetatag.aspx)
control should be placed within the `<head>` element (since it emits `<meta>`
elements).

The next important difference between the sample MSDN master page and the one
shown above is with regards to the links to CSS files. The MSDN sample only
specifies the following:

```ASP.NET
    <SharePoint:CssLink runat="server"/>
```

My master page, however, specifies the following:

```ASP.NET
    <SharePoint:CssLink runat="server" />
    <!--Styles used for positioning, font and spacing definitions-->
    <SharePoint:CssRegistration
        runat="server"
        Name="<% $SPUrl:~sitecollection/Style Library/~language/Core Styles/controls.css %>" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
        href="<% $SPUrl:~SiteCollection/Style Library/Fabrikam/Themes/Theme1/Fabrikam-Main.css%>" />
```

Note that the controls.css file is referenced in the out-of-the-box MOSS 2007
sample master pages (e.g. BlueBand.master) but for some reason was omitted from
the MSDN sample page. I've seen some blog posts that say this CSS file should
either be omitted entirely, or only rendered for content authors (by enclosing
the declaration in an
[AuthoringContainer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.publishing.webcontrols.authoringcontainer.aspx)
element). However, if you try to leverage as many OOTB SharePoint features as
possible -- including the
[SummaryLinkFieldControl](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.publishing.webcontrols.summarylinkfieldcontrol.aspx)
for displaying lists of links -- then you should reference this CSS file (or be
prepared to recreate numerous CSS rules that SharePoint would otherwise provide
for you).

Also note that I use a regular HTML `<link>` element to link in my custom CSS
file (Fabrikam-Main.css). This is because I want it to always appear last in the
list of linked CSS files and, unfortunately, the SharePoint
[CssLink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.webcontrols.csslink.aspx)
control has a nasty habit of rendering CSS links using its own ordering scheme
-- rather than how you specify items with the
[CssRegistration](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.webcontrols.cssregistration.aspx)
control (hence why some of the sample CSS files included with SharePoint include
the "zz1\_" prefix). Consequently I just use a regular HTML element to ensure I
can override any CSS rules specified by SharePoint.

Before diving into the contents of my custom CSS file, let's first cover the
purpose of my **Themes** and **Theme1** folders.

I have to admit that I initially liked the idea of
[ASP.NET themes and skins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ykzx33wh.aspx).
However, that was before I became "enlightened" by the
[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com). Consequently, when I refer to a
theme, I'm typically talking about a collection of CSS files that define the
visual structure of site at a particular point in time. Since I want to provide
the ability for a company to quickly revamp its Web site with a new
look-and-feel, I utilize a **Themes** folder with individual subfolders that
contain the CSS files (and related images) that define a specific look-and-feel.

While you can tell that I'm not really creative when it comes to names, you can
easily imagine how we could add a **Theme2** folder -- along with a new set of
CSS files, images, etc. -- and subsequently completely overhaul the visual
appearance of a site -- simply by referencing the new Fabrikam-Main.css file in
the **Theme2** folder. This is, after all, one of the compelling reasons for
implementing a Web standards design.

The reason why the custom CSS file contains the "-Main" suffix is because it
typically refers to other CSS files. For example, the first two lines of
Fabrikam-Main.css are:

```
@import url('Fabrikam-Basic.css');
@import url('960.css');
```

At the risk of stating the obvious, the 960.css file is the one that comes with
the 960 Grid System (without any changes whatsoever).

Depending on the need to support various browser versions, we might also need to
include other CSS files (such as Fabrikam-IE.css or, Heaven forbid,
Fabrikam-IE6.css). Fortunately, at least on this particular project, we have the
privilege of playing the "unsupported" trump card if people complain that they
don't like the way the site looks in Internet Explorer 6. Consequently, the
number of CSS files is very small for this project.

Here are the contents of Fabrikam-Basic.css:

```Text

The purpose of the "basic" CSS file -- as noted in the comments at the top of
the file -- is to reset the default styling that frequently varies across
different Web browsers and define the core styles of various HTML elements.

For the most part, these rules are based on the
[YUI Reset CSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/). However, you can see
that I had to make some minor changes in order to avoid fundamentally "breaking"
SharePoint (due to the rampant table-based layout that I referred to earlier).

It's important to understand that changes to the Fabrikam-Basic.css file are not
expected to occur very frequently. Rather, as new features are added to the
SharePoint site, CSS rules are added or updated in Fabrikam-Main.css.

While most of the CSS rules in Fabrikam-Main.css wouldn't be of interest to most
people (since they are specific to one particular Web site), it is worth
highlighting a few of the rules:

```CSS
/* =core (SharePoint core.css overrides)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
.ms-pagebreadcrumb {
    border: 0;
}
.ms-pagebreadcrumb a {
    background-color: inherit;
    color: inherit;
}
.ms-PartSpacingHorizontal {
    width: 0px !important;
}
.ms-MenuUIPopupBody table {
    color: #4C4C4C;
}
/* Override .ms-WPBody rules from core.css so that content within Web Parts
 * (e.g. a Content Editor Web Part) appears similar to other text on the page
 * (for example, as defined in the CSS rules for <body>) */
.ms-WPBody {
    font-family: inherit;
    font-size: inherit;
}
.ms-WPBody a:link, .ms-WPBody a:visited,
.ms-WPBody a:hover, .ms-WPBody a:active {
    color: #003399;
}
.ms-WPBody td {
    font-size: inherit;
    font-family: inherit;
}
.ms-WPBody span {
    font-size: inherit;
}
.ms-WPHeader td {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #303435;
}
.ms-WPTitle {
    color: #303435;
    font-family: inherit;
}
```

As noted in the comments above, these CSS rules are used to override rules
specified in the out-of-the-box SharePoint CSS files.

Returning to the contents of the master page, the following element is used to
encapsulate all of the page content:

```HTML
    <div class="container_12">
```

The `container_12` class refers to the 12-column template provided by the 960
Grid System.

Next comes the masthead, which contains the company logo, "welcome" area, and
page editing toolbar (i.e. `<PublishingConsole:Console runat="server" />`). The
main content for the page (i.e. `<asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="PlaceHolderMain" runat="server" />`) comes after the masthead.

Finally, the master page includes a hidden panel that encapsulates all of the
various content placeholders that are required by SharePoint, but should not be
rendered on the page. As you can see, there are a number of placeholders in MOSS
2007 that are unfortunately used strictly for presentational markup (e.g.
`PlaceHolderNavSpacer` and `PlaceHolderBodyLeftBorder`). When implementing a
site based on Web standards, you should avoid these like the H1N1 virus.
[For more information on the content placeholders specified in MOSS 2007, refer to my previous blog post ([MOSS 2007 Master Page Comparison](/blog/jjameson/2009/09/19/moss-2007-master-page-comparison)).]

This is getting to be a very long post, and there's still much I want to cover.
Therefore, I'll tack "Part 1" onto the title, publish it, and get on with more
fun things on a Saturday afternoon.

Don't fret, I'll cover many more details of Web standards design and SharePoint
~~in the very near future~~ eventually.
