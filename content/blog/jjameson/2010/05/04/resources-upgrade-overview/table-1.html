          Note that TFS 2008 supported x64 on the data-tier but not on the
          application-tier. Consequently, when I built out my TFS 2008
          environment, I used Windows Server 2008 x86 edition.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, SharePoint Server 2010 is x64 only and therefore cannot be
          installed on Windows Server 2008 x86 edition. Consequently, in order
          to upgrade to SharePoint Server 2010, I rebuilt the application-tier
          using Windows Server 2008 R2 (which, like SharePoint Server 2010, is
          only available in x64).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that there is a known issue with Windows Server 2008 R2 that may
          effect TFS (see
          <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981898">KB 981898</a>). So
          far, I haven't experienced that issue, but if I do, I'll install the
          QFE to resolve the issue.

          It's a little out-of-date (due to changes in SharePoint Server 2010
          RTM from Beta 2), but once I found the links to configure Excel
          Services and the Secure Store Service, I was able to complete the
          configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, my configuration is a little different from the
          configuration Jon used and subsequently revealed (what I believe to
          be) a bug in SharePoint Server 2010 with Excel Services. Refer to the

          When restoring data from the Production environment to the Test
          environment to perform a test of the upgrade process, I used SQL
          Server Management Studio to add permissions for the corresponding test
          accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, I added <strong>TECHTOOLBOX\svc-tfs-test </strong>to the
          corresponding TFS databases and gave it the same permissions as
          <strong> TECHTOOLBOX\svc-tfs</strong>. Similarly, I added
          <strong>TECHTOOLBOX\CYCLOPS-TEST$</strong> and give it the same
          permissions as <strong>TECHTOOLBOX\CYCLOPS$</strong> (to grant acceess
          to services configured to run as
          <strong>NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
          I used the SharePoint <strong>Mount-SPContentDatabase</strong> cmdlet
          to attach the content database containing the TFS project sites and
          discovered a few issues with the upgraded TFS sites (more detail
          provided in my next blog post).
