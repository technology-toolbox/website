While working on some documentation today, I wanted to know the names of
the Hyper-V servers running the various VMs for our Development and Test environments.
[These VMs are running in a Microsoft datacenter on the other side of the planet
from where I'm sitting.]

Unfortunately, my
[initial search using Bing](http://www.bing.com/search?q=Hyper-V+guest+determine+host&sc=1-28&FORM=PORE) failed to find what I was looking for (at least
within the first couple of pages of search results).

Fortunately,
[using an alternate search engine](http://www.google.com/search?q=Hyper-V+guest+determine+host&hl=en), I was able to quickly find the following
(on the first page of search results):

{{< reference    title="Forsyth, Scott (2009). Hyper-V - getting host information from the guest VM. 2009-10-08."    linkHref="http://weblogs.asp.net/owscott/archive/2009/10/08/hyper-v-getting-host-information-from-the-guest-vm.aspx" >}}

Thanks, Scott, for sharing this tip!
