Last Thursday, I informed my manager that I have decided to leave Microsoft to
pursue other opportunities.

My last day will be September 2nd -- just a few days shy of my 11 year
anniversary date with the company (my first day was September 5, 2000).

You might be wondering why I would choose to forgo a steady paycheck, excellent
benefits, and four weeks vacation per year -- especially in this economy. (I
know my mother certainly questions my sanity at the moment. Fortunately my wife,
on the other hand, sincerely understands my decision and respects it -- even
though it means that we will need to "cinch up our belts" for some time while I
build up my own business.)

It certainly wasn't an easy decision, but it has been one that I've been
considering for quite some time.

The reality is that being a Principal Consultant with Microsoft Consulting
Services is very challenging. However, if you know me at all, then you know that
one of the things I enjoy most is overcoming challenges -- so my decision
certainly wasn't based on "burnout" or the desire to get out of the consulting
business.

It also wasn't that I was unable to find billable work (in other words, meet my
"utilization target" -- which, by the way, was 119% for this past fiscal year).
The truth is, prior to my current project (which started in late May), I billed
the full rate for a Principal Consultant (i.e. $308.75/hr) at a *single*
customer for 18 months straight -- and no, that wasn't commissioned through one
long contract, but rather the result of numerous extensions (made possible by
continually delivering a release every six to eight weeks).

Nor was it that I had to travel full-time to work with customers (although that
is becoming the norm for many MCS consultants I know). On the contrary, I've
been working from home the vast majority of the last five years (since my
daughter was born).

So, then why am I leaving Microsoft?

The short answer is that I'm an entrepreneur at heart with a strong passion for
leveraging software to help businesses thrive, and while I could have stayed
with Microsoft Consulting Services for the foreseeable future, I believe the
time is right for change.

If you've engaged my services through Microsoft in the past, then you know that,
working together, we can achieve great things. No...not *great* things,
*amazing* things -- in incredibly short periods of time. If we haven't worked
together in the past, but you are looking for top-notch SharePoint/.NET/SQL
Server/TFS consulting services, then let's connect so we can discuss how I can
help you maximize your investment in Microsoft technology.

I've got a lot to do over the next couple of weeks before my last day -- such as
ensuring a smooth transition on my current project, obtaining a business email
address other than [jjameson@microsoft.com](mailto:jjameson@microsoft.com), and
finding a new home for my blog (which I promise will see significantly more
posts over the coming year than in years past).

I started researching alternative blog services this past weekend, and I'll be
sure to update this blog once I know the new location for "Random Musings of
Jeremy Jameson."

Until then, you can always reach me via my LinkedIn profile:
