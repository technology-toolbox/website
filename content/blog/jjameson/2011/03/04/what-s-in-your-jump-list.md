Nearly three years ago, I wrote a post that described the [BackedUp and NotBackedUp](/blog/jjameson/2007/03/22/backedup-and-notbackedup) folders I use on almost every computer I ever log on to (my laptop, desktop, a handful of servers, and more than a dozen VMs).

I also showed how I created taskbar shortcuts to quickly access my NotBackedUp and Toolbox folders.

I have long since upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7, so now I use the Windows Explorer Jump List to quickly access my most frequently used folders.

Note that Windows Server 2008 R2 also includes the Jump Lists feature. Consequently, when I log on to one of my servers (for example, my SharePoint Server 2010 development VM) I can use the same Jump List items to quickly access various folders -- thanks to the fact that I use roaming profiles in the the "[Jameson
Datacenter](/blog/jjameson/2009/09/14/the-jameson-datacenter)" (a.k.a. my home lab).

This should explain the "14" folder shown in the above screenshots. If you're a SharePoint developer, I'm sure you know where this shortcut leads to and why I have it in my Jump List ;-)
