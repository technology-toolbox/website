Two years ago, I wrote a post about
[upgrading to Internet Explorer 8](/blog/jjameson/2009/03/24/internet-explorer-8-upgrade).
Well, in case you missed the announcement a couple of days ago, Internet
Explorer 9 has been released. Woohoo!

It's been a long time coming, but I believe the wait has been well worth it.

I won't bother trying to enumerate all of the vast improvements the IE team has
made in this latest release. By now you've probably already heard a lot about
the new features in IE 9 -- such as a few of the supported HTML5 features as
well as the numerous improvements in performance. If not, you can quickly find
lots of information with
[a quick Internet search](http://www.bing.com/search?q=IE+9) followed by a few
additional clicks.

If you use the Developer Tools (F12) in IE8, then you'll notice a couple of
significant improvements in IE9. In addition to the **HTML**, **CSS**,
**Script**, and **Profiler** tabs in IE8, you'll quickly discover that IE9
contains two additional tabs: **Console** and **Network**. Now, to be honest, if
you've used Firefox/Firebug, then these two new tabs aren't going to be very
exciting to you (since they've already been available for quite some time).

However, if you are a "die hard" Internet Explorer user, then I think you will
find these welcome alternatives to other tools you may have been using for
similar purposes, such as [Fiddler](http://www.fiddler2.com). [While I don't
think the new **Network** tab in the IE9 developer tools means the eventual end
of Fiddler, I do believe it's safe to say that Fiddler will see a lot less use
as more Web developers upgrade to IE9. It's great to see things "just work" in
IE9 -- like inspecting HTTPS requests -- without having to jump through any
hoops in the process. It's not like Fiddler is difficult to use, but I think
you'll find the developer tools in IE9 to be even easier.]

Note that at this point, I've only upgraded to IE9 on my Windows 7 desktop as
well as my Microsoft-issued laptop. I'll wait until IE9 is available through
WSUS to upgrade the rest of my physical and virtual machines.
