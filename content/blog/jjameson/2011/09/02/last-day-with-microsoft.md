**Subject:** Last day with Microsoft

Today is my last day with Microsoft and it is with a heavy heart that I now say         farewell to past and present teammates, coworkers, and managers.

The last 11 years have been an incredible chapter in my life. Together we have overcome         numerous challenges, helped create amazing solutions for our customers, and enjoyed         numerous "highs" in the world of technology (and, quite frankly, perservered through         the occasional "low" as well).

I've learned more in the past decade of my life than perhaps any other, and I wouldn't         trade my decision to join Microsoft for anything (especially considering it put         me on the path to meeting my wife and eventually to our daughter). In my time here,         I've worked with some of the smartest and most talented people I've ever known.

I'm not really sure what the next 11 years hold in store for me, but the mere thought         that at the end of it, my daughter will be learning how to drive gives me great         pause (not to mention the fact that I will then be over 50).

After today, you can reach me via [{firstname}\_{lastname}@hotmail.com](mailto:{firstname}_{lastname}@hotmail.com) or using my new business email (see below).

Sometimes when I rise out of bed much too early in the morning (such as today) and         the world is quiet, I close my eyes and clearly see memories from years ago as if         they just happened yesterday. This morning, I was remembering my second day at Microsoft         when Ron Stutz told me to head over to J.D. Edwards and help a couple of other Microsoft         consultants replace Site Server on their "Knowledge Garden" solution with "Tahoe".         [For those too young to remember, "Tahoe" was the code name for SharePoint Portal         Server 2001.]

Since I am far better with technology than I am with prose, I'll leave you with         the following to express how much I appreciate our time together and sincerely hope         our paths cross again...

On             some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some             of the words are theirs.
