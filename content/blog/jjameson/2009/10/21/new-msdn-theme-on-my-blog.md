I noticed this morning that the new color scheme released this past week on
[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/) has made its way into our Community Server
template (and thus onto my blog, since I'm currently using the default "skin").

I'm still not sure how I feel about the combination of purple ( `#36295E` ) and
this particular shade of blue ( `#4EA5D2` ). I certainly like each color by
itself, it's just that when you put the two together, my stomach starts to feel
a little queasy. Oh well, I'm sure I'll get used to it.

Personally, I would have chosen one of the
[other color schemes proposed for the overhaul of MSDN](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MSDNUpdatesAndRFCForYou.aspx).
Nevertheless, this is what the Visual Studio marketing team has chosen for their
two primary colors for the 2010 release, so -- like I said before -- I'll get
used to it.

In the meantime, I've updated some of my custom style elements to match the new
color scheme.
