A couple of days ago, I rebuilt one of my development VMs for Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007. As I've noted in a
[previous post](/blog/jjameson/2009/02/10/issues-with-running-moss-2007-on-windows-server-2008),
I've found that I need to apply one of the registry hacks described in the
following KnowledgeBase article:

{{< reference
title="You receive error 401.1 when you browse a Web site that uses Integrated Authentication and is hosted on IIS 5.1 or a later version"
linkHref="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861" >}}

When I browsed to KB 896861 this week, I noticed that it has been updated since
the last time I saw it. Apparently, this has become such a common issue that
Microsoft now provides an automated way to fix the issue:

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <a style="WIDTH: 139px; DISPLAY: block; BACKGROUND: url(http://support.microsoft.com/library/images/support/KBGraphics/PUBLIC/cn/FixItButton.jpg) no-repeat 0px 0px; HEIGHT: 56px;"
  title="Microsoft Fix it"
  href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9686309"></a>
</div>
<div class="text-center">

[Fix this problem](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9686309 "Microsoft Fix it")\
Microsoft Fix it 50306

</div>

This was the first time I've seen a reference to **Microsoft Fix it**, and I
have to say that I like it -- and for more than just the cute moniker and button
image, too!
