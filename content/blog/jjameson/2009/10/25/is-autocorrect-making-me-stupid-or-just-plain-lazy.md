[Yesterday's post](/blog/jjameson/2009/10/24/the-original-jameson-datacenter)
got me thinking about something.

Do you find yourself occasionally typing one word when you are actually thinking
of a different word that sounds the same? A faint recollection from one or more
of my English classes long ago suggested that these words are called *homonyms*.
However, a quick search just now on Wikipedia indicates these are actually
[*homophones*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone).

For example, have you ever typed the word "do" when you meant "due", or
similarly "overdo" when you meant "overdue"? Surely you know the difference
between the two, yet somehow in the time that it takes your fingers to turn your
thoughts into characters, then words, and eventually sentences on the screen,
something goes terribly wrong.

I honestly can't ever remember doing this as child, although it undoubtedly
happened more than a few times as my vocabulary grew at a faster pace than my
ability to spell. I definitely don't remember it happening in high school or
college. This made me wonder if this infliction is somehow related to typing --
or more specifically, my typing speed (which has vastly increased since my
college days). This got me thinking that perhaps it's not actually related to my
skills as a typist, but somehow related to the fact many of the applications I
use on a daily basis have some sort of "auto-correct" feature.

Consider the AutoCorrect feature in Microsoft Word -- and Outlook -- as an
example. I have to wonder if the fact that this has been fixing my typing and
spelling errors for almost fifteen years has somehow made me just a little too
dependent on this feature. I can honestly say that I don't do as much
proofreading today as I used to a few years ago, and this really isn't a good
thing.

It's probably overkill to proofread every single e-mail message before sending
it out, but at the same time, isn't it embarrassing to send a message that uses
the word "to" when it should be "too"?

Of course, I'm not saying that these errors are the fault of software features
like AutoCorrect. Surely I'm the one that bears ultimate responsibility for the
words I write. Perhaps I just need to consider disabling the AutoCorrect feature
in Word and Outlook for a while -- or better yet, maybe I should look for an old
[IBM Selectric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter) on ebay
and subject myself to some exercises on that for a little while. Without a
doubt, a few dozen pages on that -- and a couple of bottles of Liquid Paper, of
course -- would cure whatever ailment I seem to have contracted in the last few
years.
