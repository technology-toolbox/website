A couple of days ago, I rebuilt one of my development VMs for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007. As I've noted in a [previous post](/blog/jjameson/2009/02/10/issues-with-running-moss-2007-on-windows-server-2008), I've found that I need to apply one of the registry hacks described in the following KnowledgeBase article:

<cite>You receive error 401.1 when you browse a Web site that uses Integrated Authentication and is hosted on IIS 5.1 or a later version</cite>
[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861)

When I browsed to KB 896861 this week, I noticed that it has been updated since the last time I saw it. Apparently, this has become such a common issue that Microsoft now provides an automated way to fix the issue:

[Fix this problem](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9686309 "Microsoft Fix it")
Microsoft Fix it 50306

This was the first time I've seen a reference to **Microsoft Fix it**, and I have to say that I like it -- and for more than just the cute moniker and button image, too!
