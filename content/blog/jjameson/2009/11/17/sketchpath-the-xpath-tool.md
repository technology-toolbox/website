I added another tool to my [Toolbox](/blog/jjameson/2007/03/22/backedup-and-notbackedup) yesterday: SketchPath.

The [SketchPath site](http://www.sketchpath.com/) labels it as "The XPath Tool" but I'd say it more like "*The* XPath Tool."

I've seen a few other tools for quickly building and testing XPath expressions against an XML document, but they pale in comparison to SketchPath. There are a number of online tools that unquestionably require less effort to get started with, but you'll likely find them very limiting as well.

I know I'm not the only one who thinks SketchPath rocks. Scott Hanselman included it in his [2009 Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2009UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx).

If you do any significant amount of work with XML, I recommend you download SketchPath today.
