SharePoint 2010 is coming!

Last week, I spent 7 days in "alpha" training for SharePoint 2010 up in Redmond.
Needless to say, it was a very long week packed full of great information on
what's new in the next version.

Note that we have been explicitly told not to share publicly any features,
demos, screenshots, or other details until the SharePoint Conference in October.
However, I think it is safe to say that even based on the CTP version of
SharePoint Server 2010 that we used in the class, this will be another exciting
release for the World of SharePoint!

If you want to get a glimpse at some of the new features of the next version, I
encourage you to take a few minutes and explore the
[SharePoint 2010 sneak peek site](http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/2010/sneak_peek).
