In my [previous
post](/blog/jjameson/2008/04/01/tfs-lite-for-wss-v2), I introduced my "TFS Lite" SharePoint site template that I've been         using for years as a simple scenario/task/bug/risk/milestone tracking "application"         with various projects and customers. In today's post, I'll discuss some of the important         changes in Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) v3 that impacted TFS Lite, such as         the fact that *all* SharePoint lists now support versioning, not just the **Issues**         list, as was the case in WSS v2 and SharePoint Portal Server (SPS) 2003.

As I noted in the earlier post, the Work Items list at the heart of TFS Lite was         originally based on the Issues list in order to maintain a history as items are         modified. When you are dealing with sensitive items like bugs and risks, a simple         snapshot of the latest item simply won't do. You need traceability to determine         who said what and when. Granted, there are times when I wish I could "undo" or "rollback"         a change to a list item -- for example, when I enter comments on a bug like "Fixed         in 3.0.220.0" but neglect to change the **Status** to **Resolved**. However,         dealing with goofs like that just comes with the territory when you need a detailed         audit history of every change to an item.

When working with the previous versions of WSS and SPS, the various views used to         render snapshots of the Work Items list specified **Current is equal to Yes**         in order to show only the latest version of each work item. Since any list in WSS         v3 can now inherently support versioning, it is no longer necessary to base the         Work Items list on the Issues list, nor is it necessary to include the **Current is
equal to Yes** criteria in each view.

The other significant change in WSS v3 that impacted TFS Lite is the way related         items are entered. In WSS v2 and SPS 2003, the Issues list allowed you to simply         type in the ID for a related issue to associate two or more items together. Furthermore,         in WSS v2 when you added, for example, issue 1 as a related item to issue 2, then         when you viewed issue 1, you would see issue 2 as a related item, and vice-versa.         The net result in WSS v2 was that if you related issue 1 to issue 2 and then subsequently         related issue 2 to issue 3, then issues 1, 2, and 3 were all interrelated. This         is not the case in WSS v3.

In WSS v3, however, when you add issue 1 as a related item to issue 2, the related         item only shows up on issue 2 (in other words, issue 1 does not show that it is         related to issue 2). Also note that the user interface changed from a simple textbox         in WSS v2 (in which you simply type the ID of the related issue) to a pair of lists         in WSS v3 (in which you select one or more items in the list on the left and then         click **Add &gt;** to associate them to the current item). These changes can         be considered good or bad -- depending on your perspective.

If you like the fact that you can now associate multiple issues at a single time         (and also view the title of each item when selecting related issues), then this         is great. However, if you liked the "bidirectional association" in WSS v2 or if         you have many items in your list (say, around 2,500) then:

1. The user experience of having to select from a list containing thousands of items
   leaves much to be desired.
2. There is definitely a performance impact when you create or edit an item (since
   SharePoint has to fetch all items in the list to allow you to possibly associate
   any one of them to the current item).

With these WSS v3 changes in mind, let's "upgrade" the TFS Lite site template accordingly...

Here is a step-by-step guide for creating the TFS Lite site template for WSS v3:

1. Create a new site collection using the **Team Site** template.

2. Optionally delete the **Tasks** list that is automatically created as part of
   the Team Site template (since a "task" is simply a work item where Category = "Task").

3. Create a new list called **WorkItems** based on the **Tasks** list and select
   **Yes** for the **Send e-mail when ownership is assigned?** option.

4. Rename the **WorkItems** list to **Work Items**. (I prefer to avoid spaces
   when creating lists to avoid "garbage" in the URLs as a result of URL encoding.)

5. Enable versioning on the **Work Items** list to create a version each time someone
   edits an item in this list.

6. Add the columns specified in the following table:
   
   |                             Column Name<br>                         |                             Description<br>                         |                             Type<br>                         |                             Required<br>                         |                             Additional Information<br>                         |                             Default<br>                         |                             Add to Default View<br>                         |

<small>* Change the filter as necessary to match the current iteration.</small>
11. (Optional) Modify the **Project Summary** Web Part to display an image corresponding
to the designated KPI value (using SharePoint Designer and a tiny bit of XSLT as
described in my [previous post](/blog/jjameson/2008/04/01/tfs-lite-for-wss-v2)).
12. In the **Links** list, add a link to the **Project Summary** page.

You might be wondering why I chose to base the Work Items list on Tasks instead         of just creating a custom list from scratch. Aside from the fact that the Tasks         list saves me from having to create a few columns, the real reason is to automatically         e-mail team members when a work item is assigned to them. If you simply create a         custom list and add an **Assigned To** column, you'll find that the option to         **Send e-mail when ownership is assigned?** is conspicuously absent from the         **Advanced Settings** page for the list.

You certainly don't have to implement the list this way. Alternatively, you could         choose to use alerts instead and have people "subscribe" to changes in the **My Work
Items** view. However, I chose a "push" model instead of a "pull" model to         ensure people are always alerted right away when they are responsible for working         on something.

You also might be wondering how work items can be related to each other since I         chose not to base the new Work Items list on the Issues list. Given the change in         behavior in the WSS v3 Issues list for related items, I recommend simply adding         a section to the **Description** field name named **Related Items** and then         insert hyperlinks to other items. The primary reason for this is to avoid the performance         impact as the number of work items grows large.

> There appears to be a bug in WSS v3 (and MOSS 2007) where the Web Parts on the Project Summary page are not configured with the correct views after creating a new site from the attached site template. Consequently you will need to spend a few minutes reconfiguring the Web Parts using the settings specified in step 10 above. The Web Parts are created, but the columns, sort, filter, and group by settings revert to the default values. Fortunately it only takes a few minutes to workaround this bug.

> The issue noted below by Dragan has been corrected. The fix is described in [a subsequent post](/blog/jjameson/2008/04/08/creating-a-site-template-in-moss-2007-that-works-in-wss-v3). However, as I originally suspected might be the case, the KPI images that I use in the project dashboard view are only available in MOSS 2007. Consequently you will need to substitute your own images (or simply revert to displaying the status as text).
