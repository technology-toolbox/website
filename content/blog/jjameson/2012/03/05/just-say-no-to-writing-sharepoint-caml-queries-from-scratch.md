excerpt: "Do you use the U2U CAML Query Builder instead of writing CAML queries from scratch? If not, then you must really know your SharePoint (or perhaps you just enjoy making things harder than they need to be)."

In yesterday's Scrum for the project I started last Thursday, a brief discussion came up around writing SharePoint CAML queries.

One of the developers mentioned creating a view, adding "placeholders" for filter parameters, and then copying the CAML for the view into your code.

I asked if anyone had ever used the U2U CAML Query Builder, but apparently they had never come across this before.

I've been using it since the old MOSS 2007 days, and I still use it today with SharePoint 2010. It is far easier than trying to handcraft CAML queries.

Here is the link to this wonderful tool, in case you haven't come across it either:
