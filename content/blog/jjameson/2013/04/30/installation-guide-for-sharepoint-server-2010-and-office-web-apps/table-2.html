        The server farm account is used to create and access the SharePoint
        configuration database. It also acts as the application pool identity
        account for the SharePoint Central Administration application pool, and
        it is the account under which the Windows SharePoint Services Timer
        service runs. The SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard adds this
        account to the SQL Server <strong>dbcreator</strong> and
        <strong>securityadmin</strong> server roles.<br /><br />The farm service
        account must be a domain user account, but it does not need to be a
        member of any specific security group on the servers in the farm. It is
        recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and specify a
        user account that is not a member of the Administrators group on any of
        the servers in the farm.
