At Technology Toolbox we respect your privacy. You may visit our site without
providing any personal information to us. If and when you decide to share
personal information with us, we are committed to protecting that information.

The following sections provide an overview of the information we collect and how
we protect your privacy.

## Non-Personal Information

When you visit this site, certain kinds of non-personal information may be
collected automatically, such as the website that referred you to us, access
time, and browser type. We may also collect information about the pages you
view, the links you click, and other actions you perform while visiting the
site.

## Personal Information

If you choose to register for additional features and services, or perform
certain actions -- such as adding a comment to a blog post -- we will ask you to
provide personal information.

We use cookies to keep track of your interaction with our site in order to offer
a personalized experience.

We do not sell, rent, or lease our customer information to third parties.

If you wish to have any of your personal information removed, please
[contact us](/contact).

## Information Security

Protecting your personal information is very important to us, and we take
appropriate steps to maintain the security of your data on
TechnologyToolbox.com. For example, we use firewalls and additional security
measures to secure your personal information against unauthorized access and
theft.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or means of electronic
storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Technology Toolbox reserves the right to change the terms of this privacy
policy. When a change is made, we will revise the "last updated" date above. If
there are material changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you by
prominently posting a notice of the changes here or on the home page of the
site, or by sending you an email.
