Microsoft SQL Server is the foundation for many enterprise systems, from
SharePoint and Team Foundation Server, to ERP, CRM, POS, and inventory
management. If your business relies on SQL Server to provide a scalable,
reliable, and secure data platform, we can help you extract more value from your
mission-critical applications and infrastructure.

## Database Performance Tuning and Optimization

Are you experiencing performance issues in your SQL Server deployment and
thinking about purchasing new or additional hardware?

We often identify opportunities for improving performance without "throwing more
hardware" at the problem. In some cases it makes sense to add hardware to
resolve the issue -- in which case we can provide specific recommendations.
However, without a thorough understanding of the root cause of your performance
issues, you will likely find yourself in the same situation in the very near
future.

We can also provide recommendations for optimizing other areas of your
enterprise systems to vastly reduce SQL Server workloads.

## SQL Server Architecture

Working with your people, we assess your business needs and provide
recommendations for an optimal SQL Server architecture, whether you are
deploying SharePoint, Team Foundation Server, or a custom application.

If you are looking to upgrade to SQL Server 2019 or consolidate a number of
SQL Server instances, we create a roadmap with a migration plan specific to your
scenario.

## Business Intelligence

Many businesses rely on operational systems that have been in place for years
and hold vast amounts of data. Yet these same organizations struggle with
extracting useful information from these systems -- often relying on manual
processes to gather and analyze the data.

Using the Microsoft Business Intelligence platform, we can help you connect
people to information in a secure, self-service fashion that minimizes cost and
IT management issues. Using familiar tools like Microsoft Excel and SharePoint,
business users can create their own reports and easily share their analysis with
others.

Technology Toolbox has proven expertise in designing enterprise data warehouses
and creating the corresponding processes to extract and transform data from
various sources and subsequently load it into the warehouse.

With the enterprise data warehouse in place, we show you how to create flexible
dashboards and reporting solutions to quickly extract valuable information to
facilitate key business decisions.
