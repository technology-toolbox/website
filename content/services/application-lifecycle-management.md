Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a continuous process involving all
aspects of software development -- including gathering business and technical
requirements, planning and architecture, implementation, testing, project
tracking, change management, and release management.

In the past, creating and managing software solutions required teams to use a
variety of tools and processes that were often loosely integrated or, worse,
completely disconnected from each other. For example, testers often tracked bugs
and issues using Excel spreadsheets or a simple Web application, and developers
would subsequently reference these sources in order to resolve them.

Using a multitude of tools and processes -- within and across roles --
inherently impedes a software project. The velocity of the team is significantly
reduced due to a variety of factors. For example, team members often perform
non-value added activities like manually extracting and aggregating data from
various sources in order to communicate project status to management.

Implementing an effective ALM solution removes inefficiencies in the development
process and substantially reduces the complexity and risks in delivering
technology solutions. By increasing team collaboration and productivity,
application lifecycle management dramatically improves project success rates and
helps avoid unexpected costs due to schedule overruns, poor software quality,
and lack of effective change management.

## Azure DevOps

Previously known as Team Foundation Server (TFS), Azure DevOps Server is
Microsoft's core platform for application lifecycle management. It provides
fundamental services such as work item tracking, version control, and build
automation. Azure DevOps Server includes dashboards and flexible reporting
capabilities that provide visibility into the overall project health, while
promoting greater transparency regarding potential problems.

Previously known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps Services is
the cloud-hosted "software as a service" fully managed by Microsoft.

While making the decision to adopt Azure DevOps is a great first step, it does
not immediately enable your organization to realize the full potential of
application lifecycle management.

Technology Toolbox provides a variety of offerings to help you plan, deploy, and
optimize Azure DevOps:

- Assessment
- Azure DevOps Pilot
- Workshops

## Assessment

We recommend starting with an assessment of your current processes and tools in
order to provide a roadmap for successfully migrating or upgrading to Azure
DevOps. By first understanding the maturity of your software development
organization, we can identify the "low hanging fruit" for improving the
predictability and success of your software projects in the short term, while
also providing recommendations for improving efficiency over the longer term.

## Azure DevOps Pilot

Regardless of whether you are upgrading from a previous version of TFS or
migrating from a different toolset, we recommend using an Azure DevOps "lab
environment" -- either in the cloud or on-premises -- to understand the various
capabilities and gain valuable hands-on experience using real world scenarios.

For example, using a lab environment, we can show you how to quickly implement
an automated daily build and deployment process -- or continuous integration, if
you prefer -- that incorporates best practices like incrementing assembly
versions with each build. A lab environment is also ideal for understanding and
evaluating different branching strategies and other aspects of source control
management.

Once you are ready for a production deployment, we can help you migrate a real
project in order to verify the solution and document the governance of your
Azure DevOps instance going forward.

## Workshops

If you already have Azure DevOps configured, Technology Toolbox can deliver a
variety of workshops to increase your knowledge of specific ALM techniques. For
example, your team may be looking for ways to work more effectively in parallel
on multiple versions of your solution (in other words, creating new features and
enhancements for vNext while also implementing hotfixes for the current
release). We provide focused two-day workshops that cover this scenario and many
others.
