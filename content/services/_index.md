Technology Toolbox helps businesses successfully plan, architect, implement, and
deploy solutions based on Microsoft products and technologies.

Our practice is focused on three main areas:

- Application Lifecycle Management
- SharePoint Architecture and Development
- Databases and Business Intelligence

## Application Lifecycle Management

Regardless of whether you are creating custom applications using the core .NET
Framework or deploying solutions based on SharePoint to rapidly address changing
business needs, you need a solid foundation for continuously managing all
aspects of the development lifecycle.

## SharePoint Architecture and Development

SharePoint is without question a powerful and robust platform that enables
organizations of all sizes to be more productive. However, for all but the
smallest of companies, a successful SharePoint deployment is certainly not a
given.

Technology Toolbox helps you plan, customize, and deploy SharePoint 2010 to
address your specific needs, whether you are upgrading from a previous version
or migrating from another platform.

## Databases and Business Intelligence

Databases are the backbone of most mission-critical enterprise systems. When
there are performance issues or failures in these systems, the cost to the
business can be enormous. Fortunately, with proper planning and performance
tuning, these disasters can be avoided. We can also provide recommendations for
optimizing other areas of your enterprise systems to vastly reduce SQL Server
workloads.

In most businesses today, operational systems have been in place for many years
and hold vast amounts of data. However, truly useful information remains elusive
or cumbersome to gather and analyze. We can help you connect people to
information in a secure, self-service fashion that minimizes cost and IT
management issues. [Read more](/services/databases-and-business-intelligence)
